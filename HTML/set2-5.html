    <h1>Black Hole</h1>

    A black hole is a massive, compact <a target = "_blank" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object">astronomical object </a>so dense that 
    its gravity prevents anything from escaping, even light. Albert Einstein's 
    theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will 
    form a black hole.[3] The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. 
    A black hole has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object 
    crossing it, but has no locally detectable features according to general 
    relativity.[4] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, 
    as it reflects no light.[5][6] Quantum field theory in curved spacetime 
    predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum 
    as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This 
    temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black 
    holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.
